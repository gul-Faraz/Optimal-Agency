                            <p>TikTok started out as a predominantly young social environment, but now the average age for TikTok users in the U.S. is in the late twenties.&nbsp; Now TikTok has every highly coveted demographic for advertisers.</p>



                            <p>Next, TikTok audience is highly engaged with the platform, much more so than, say, Instagram or Twitter. This means that they are more likely to engage with your content, as long as you do it right and create what they want to see. For this, you need <a href="https://growmojo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knowledgeable experts from a TikTok advertising agency</a> as they know just what content clicks with the TikTok crowd, and what doesn’t.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>On TikTok, users come for authentic, creative content that makes them feel good and cheers them up. Also, they want content that provides value – in many cases, interesting “how-tos” and “did you know that” sort of content.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>Real, raw and relatable content by real people – this is the gist of TikTok. Not highly produced, curated branded content. That’s one of the key differences between TikTok and other platforms, <a href="https://growmojo.com/instagram-vs-tiktok-which-is-better-for-your-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially Instagram</a>. A good TikTok advertising agency knows just how to translate this quality into your ads, regardless of your field.&nbsp;</p>



                            <h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Choose an agency that is expert in creating video ads.&nbsp;</h2>



                            <p>This one is very important. TikTok is obviously a video-based platform and it essentially pioneered video-centered content on social media. Therefore, it comes with its own set of specific traits, both in creation and in consummation. Again, these are not some curated, staged, highly aestheticized or branded videos. On TikTok, videos are raw, organic, real, creative, but authentic.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>For a brand, creating such content is actually much more difficult than it may appear. If you don’t do it right, you’ll come off as a fake and your videos will appear condescending and cringy – like a boomer trying to do what the “cool kids” do. To avoid this trap, partner up with an agency that has a rich portfolio of video ads that actually performed well on TikTok and that have no problems keeping up with the high volume of ad production that is required on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



                            <h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Choose an agency with a deep understanding of different TikTok features</h2>



                            <p>In its core, TikTok is a feature-rich platform with plenty of tools that brands can use to entertain and engage their audience. And then, there are add-ons and various strategies you can implement to boost engagement, go viral or reach even wider audiences.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p><a href="https://growmojo.com/why-instant-pages-are-necessary-for-your-tiktok-ad-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok instant pages</a>, for example, are displayed within the App and represent a terrific way to showcase your product and drive conversions. Then there are <a href="https://growmojo.com/introducing-tiktok-spark-ads-a-new-powerful-marketing-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spark Ads</a>, the organic ad format designed to boost brand awareness.</p>



                            <p>TikTok also offers a range of Interactive Add-Ons, such as display cards, various stickers, gestures and pop-up showcases. <a href="https://growmojo.com/introducing-tiktok-pulse-a-new-way-to-supercharge-ad-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok Pulse</a> places brand ads front and center, right alongside top 4% creators and most viral videos. You also have branded effects, <a href="https://growmojo.com/tiktok-shop-seller-center/">TikTok Seller Center</a> and so much more.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>The agency you team up with needs to possess a perfect understanding of all the features and solutions that come with the platform. They need to know just which features and ad formats are most suitable for your brand and how to create content for those formats. They need to be able to constantly feel the pulse of the platform and leverage any new features the moment they roll out.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Given the nature of TikTok and its audience, the ads need to feel organic and draw the viewers in. The attention span of TikTok users is quite short so you don’t have a lot of room for growing on them.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>One of the defining traits of TikTok is its algorithm, designed to bring forth popular and engaging content based on user interest and behavior. Trends play a key role here because they help the algorithm identify what’s currently popular and what sort of content people are engaging with the most.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>These trends are not limited solely on content type (e.g. viral dance challenges, cooking and life hacks, etc). The platform itself also changes constantly and <a href="https://growmojo.com/10-exciting-tiktok-trends-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certain TikTok trends</a> regarding its features can be predicted – if you’re an expert.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>Always go with an agency that possesses the kind of substantial knowledge of TikTok that enables it to predict and really understand trends. That way, you’re making sure you’re always ahead of the curve.</p>



                            <h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Choose an agency that has a firm grasp of TikTok’s strict policy restrictions</h2>



                            <p>Not only is TikTok very strict in community guidelines (zero tolerance for bullying, violence, nudity, pornography, alcohol, drugs and any sexual content), it also has rather firm policy rules when it comes to advertising.&nbsp;</p>



                            <p>Ads must be clearly marked and make no false claims. Infringement of intellectual property and deceptive practices are strictly forbidden, and so are contests or giveaways without due disclosure. There’s a list of products that cannot be advertised on TikTok, including, but not limited to weapons, illegal drugs, tobacco and adult products. There are also many other categories of advertisers like medical devices, law firms, health and fitness products that need special approval for their ad to run on TikTok.</p>



                            <p>A good TikTok advertising agency knows each and every policy restriction inside out and can therefore help you avoid violations and penalties. Also, a TikTok approved agency can work with the <a href="https://growmojo.com/tiktok-advertising-policy/">TikTok policy team</a> to get restricted ads live. Because not everyone among your competition can say this, it gives you a significant upper hand and enables you to run healthy, successful campaigns that convert.&nbsp;</p>
